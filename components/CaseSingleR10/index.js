                                                        Over the years we have witnessed an exponential growth in higher education fees prohibiting thousands of Black students’ access. This problem saw the rise of student protests like the #FeesMustFall movement that began in 2015. Since 2015, there have been various advocacy related activities by students to make higher education accessible. In the beginning of 2021, we again witnessed student protests all over the country over the following challenges:
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        ▪ Registration fees: not affording registration fees excludes deserving students from being allowed to study towards their dream qualification: and </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        ▪ Increase of fees: Data shows that 70% of students at some point during the academic year cannot afford to buy food, 68% are unable to afford student materials, and 62% feel they could not afford to pay to participate in campus-based social and academic activities.

                                                        In March this year, students were unable to register due to a lack of funding. The protests inspired social media celebrity, Lasizwe Dambuza and friends into action and the #R10 Goes a long Way campaign was started – first raising R38 000 between the four friends, Takkies Nkateko, Sibu Mabena, Ayanda Mhlongo.

                                                        On 13 March Sibu Mabena, Ayanda Mhlongo, Lasizwe Dambuza and Nkateko Dinwiddy deposited R38 000 into the Duma Investment FNB, Account Number: 62859284152 Cheque Account to kick start #R10GoesALongWay to help students.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The initiative went on to raise over R2 million in 5 days to help the most deserving students with registration fees, giving  them access to education. FundiFund was asked to get involved – and of the 19 000 funding applications received, we were able to fund the registration fees of 106 student’s of the 161 selected from the first draw.
